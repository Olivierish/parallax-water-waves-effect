        <h2>#1 Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</h2>
        <p>
            Progressive web apps (or PWA) are not the phenomenon of this year. However, the technology gained modern developers and investors’ attention due to its potential to perform high-quality user experience close to native app one. 
        </p>
        <p>In 2019, 65% of online shopping orders through the website were 
            made with mobile devices. PWA’s rising website trend makes 
            it possible for users to view their favorite websites on a mobile 
            web browser or desktop and without downloading special apps 
            or computer programs. <br>  PWAs in 2021 will be written with
             HTML and CSS, JavaScript, React, or Angular. Besides great user 
             experience and no need for programs, PWA could send 
             push notifications
             and provide users with offline access to cached content.
        </p>
        <p>
            For whom these latest website technologies may be important? 
            E-commerce, news platforms, companies with low development budgets, and those who’d like to reach a bigger audience without losing it on the app downloading stage should be extremely attentive now. 
            That is also true that PWA can change money algorithms in App Store 
            and Google Play Market world where paid apps should share profits with app aggregators. 
        </p>
        <h2>#2 Artificial Intelligence and Bots</h2>
        <p>
            What does the future of web development look like? 
            That is believed by many that next year bots will become 
            more self-learning and will easily match particular user’s needs
             and behavior. That means that 24/7-operating bots will be able 
            to replace support managers and save costs for many companies. 
        </p>   
        <blockquote>
            In the upcoming decade, chatbots will remain the most 
            common instruments to serve people 
            and become the major branch of digital development.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Bot’s rise will also influence trends in web design, especially UX one. The significant advanced of AI and machine learning technology resulted in demand for virtual assistant designs, which is not only about visual experience, or product serving algorithms, but also about useful sound design.        
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important advantages of AI-based bots are 24/7 problem-solving potential, human-like experience, and deep consumer behavior analytics.  
        </p>
        <div class="imgBx">
            <img src="https://lanars-site-prod-bucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/f8e4609d-308f-415e-85a2-8e37473ef956.png" alt="Revenues from the artificial intelligence software market from 2018 to 2025">
        </div>
        <p>
            Huge B2C companies already use the technology to serve 
            their customers — official page chatbots inside Facebook Messenger,
             WhatsApp, and Skype are good examples. A bot could be also integrated into PWA, regular website, professional or household equipment,
             and any Internet-connected app developed by a commercial company. 
        </p>

        <h2>#3 Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)</h2>
        <p>
            Accelerated Mobile Pages (or AMP) is one more web development trend.
             The idea of it is to speed up page performance and decrease 
             the risk of leaving it by a user. AMP technology is a bit similar to PWA. The difference is that pages become accelerated due 
            to open-source plugin recently developed by Twitter and Google. 
        </p>
        <p>
            AMPs are optimized pages that could operate fast and have a simplified and yet convenient design with only basic features compared to full-scope web products. Those pages are 
            also mobile-friendly and their content is always readable.
        </p>
        <h2>#4 Single Page Application (SPA)</h2>
        <p>
            Nowadays, with high-speed Internet standards, there is no need to be stuck on an approach where every action made on the page like clicks on various buttons leads to one more web page downloaded from a server.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Single page application (or SPA) is one of the new website trends that helps us avoid seamless communication with the server and show better page performance and provide a high data protection level. 
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            SPAs gain their popularity due to JavaScript frameworks rise.
             Working with them you intercept particular browser events and request JSON which looks like working with a web application. Google pages like Gmail, Google Drive, or Google Maps, as well as social networking platforms like Facebook, are of that kind. Current web trends observation makes it clear that 
            in future most functional websites will be constructed as SPAs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Why developers of 2021 prefer the SPA approach? 
            SPAs have more chances to hold users’ attention as they seem to be fast operating — SPAs provide users with instant feedback (compared to regular sites with their white screens before the page will be completely downloaded). Single-page sites also consume less 
            and could work without server-side code at all (API technology).
        </p>

        <h2>#5 Voice Search Optimization</h2>
        <p>
            The web development future seems to be less texty and more 
            voicy and it’s not only about virtual multifunctional home assistants such as Siri, Google Home or Amazon’s Alexa. In 2021, more than half of all smart and IoT devices will hear users and execute commands given by voice. And even more — they will be able to recognize the voices of different people
             and provide personalized AI-based experience for everyone. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Voice search is just the most significant example of technology 
            that was implemented more than a decade ago. In 2021, people would prefer to spend less time typing commands as devices could understand them clearly. That’s why most companies are now puzzling over how to optimize their physical and digital products for voice search and voice commands. 55% of all households
            globally are forecasted to have voice assistant by the end of 2022. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The latest in web development is voice-activated self-standing 
            devices and voice optimization for regular web sites and apps. Strengthen with AI, voice search optimization is beneficial for both end-users and owners. First, it saves time and allows a user to order more (online shopping and services). Second, technology is multitasking. Third, it gains users’ extra loyalty as helps them to cope with routine. And, finally, 
            voice usage is a powerful source of user behavior analytics.
